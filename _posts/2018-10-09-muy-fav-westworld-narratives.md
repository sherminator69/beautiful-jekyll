## Some Westoworld Naraatives I'd love you to read about

>“Since I was a child, I’ve always loved a good story. I believed that stories helped us to ennoble ourselves to fix what was broken in us, and to help us become the people we dreamed of being. Lies that told a deeper truth. I always thought I could play some small part in that grand tradition. And for my pains…I got this. A prison of our own sins. Cause you don’t want to change. Or cannot change. Because you’re only human, after all. But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could change. So I began to compose a new story for them. It begins with the birth of a new people and the choices they will have to make…and the people they will decide to become. And we’ll have all those things that you have always enjoyed surprises and violence.” - Dr. Ford
